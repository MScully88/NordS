Worrying about being too 'wordy' is slowing development. Solution: I'm going to ramble.

Gleichweis, worrying about sounding preachy is slowing development. An eye rollingly self-righteous app is bad; but better than silence. 

Anyway, I'd rather edit clumsy content down to prose, than  beat poetry out of a muse. 

So if your reading this, well, skim. And please

What I want this app to do is lead the player through the process of slaughtering a pig in a way that is truthful,
and compelling.

Ideally, the player should think,
1 oh, this is interesting;
then 
2 oh, this is horrifying -
without recoiling from the simulation, in the way s/he might from raw slaughterhouse footage.

In my experience, most people are genuinely kind and good most of the time. Almost nobody would kill all the animals they consume; because they would hate to cause so much unnecessary cruelty. That's the heart of it. There is some protective barrier in our reality map, which allows us to consume a product without connecting it to a cruelty our consumption causes. This app is about piercing that barrier.
